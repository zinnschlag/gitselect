===== ABOUT =====

gitselect is a command line tool, that lets the user quickly select a file from a git
repository. This file is then used to issue another command (by default opening it in
gedit).

Note: This tool was motivated by the ALT-G shortcut of the Code::Blocks IDE.

====== INSTALLING ======

gitselect can be installed from source using:

./setup.py install

====== USAGE ======

Enter the command gitselect while somewhere in a git repository. This will split the
console in two parts.

Upper: A list of all versioned files. You can navigte this list with cursor up and
cursur down. Pressing return will trigger the predefined action and exit gitselect.

Lower: An input field. Any text entered here will be used as a filter for the file list
in the upper part (only files will be listed, that contain the string in the input field).

====== CONFIGURATION ======

gitselect is configured through a file named .gitselect in the user's home directory. If
gitselect is run and this file does not exist, it is created (containing default settings).
